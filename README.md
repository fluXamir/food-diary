## 🚧 Project Status

This project was built during my **first year**, and I no longer remember all the implementation details or how to run it completely.

> ⚠️ If you try to run it, you might need to:
> - Open the project in NetBeans
> - Reconnect the database (e.g., reconfigure JDBC or local database file)
> - Update any outdated libraries

## 📂 How to Explore (if you're curious)

1. Open the `.java` and `.form` files in **NetBeans**
2. Look inside for database connection code (usually in `main` or `dbConnect` classes)
3. Update database path/connection if needed
